The image encryption is a python code with the name 15IT245_M2_ImageEncr.py. It encrypts a grayscale image. It is run using the following command in the terminal:
$python 15IT245_ImageEncr.py

The code for encrypting the image and hiding the image in cover image is a python code with name 15IT245_M2_ImageStego.py. It is run using the following command in the terminal:
$python 15IT245_ImageStego.py


The screenshots of the output are included as images. 5 test cases are used, i.e 5 secret images and 5 cover images are used.They are named as(for all the test cases):

1. Secret Image: 15IT245_M2_cover.png
2. Cover Image: 15IT245_M2_image.png

After encrypting and hiding the encrypted image in the cover image produces following files as output:
1. 15IT245_decrypted.png
2. 15IT245_encrypted.png: The image generated after encrypting the 15IT245_M2_grayscale.png image
3. 15IT245_M2_stego.png: The stego image generated after hiding the 15IT245_M2_encrypted.png image in 15IT245_M2_cover.png image.



According to these test cases, the output is stored in the corresponding log files named as(for all the 5 testcases):

15IT245_M2_log.txt
